        <h3>
        The Palestinian Archive Society for Documentation (PASD) at Al-Quds University is a student and researcher-led initiative dedicated to preserving and documenting Palestine's rich history, culture, and heritage, including that of its diaspora.
        <br /><br /> 
        Recognizing the critical need to safeguard the stories and memories that define the past, PASD works to create a comprehensive and collective archive that embodies Palestinian resilience. 
        <br /><br />
        Built on resources that capture the essence of the Palestinian legacy, the archive is continuously organized, preserved, and expanded, serving as both a historical record and a living resource that connects past experiences with future aspirations.
        <br /><br />
        Join us in this continuous effort to document, safeguard, and share stories about Palestine's legacy as part of a greater purpose of resilience and cultural preservation.
